In order to get kernel compilation working, make sure you follow one of these steps:

- You have 3 folders: kernel, mediatek and prebuilts.
  - kernel folder is the basic one, with the linux kernel sources.
  - mediatek folder contains dependences that are necessary to build for MTK platform.
  - prebuilts folder contains the appropriate cross-compiler.


- In Terminal, cd to kernel folder:
  -- Edit build.sh (line 13) and set the path to your CROSS_COMPILE if different

- To begin with the build process:
  -- Go back to project root folder
  -- Run command: ./mk -t newmann1 n k

- Once finished, you will find:
  -- The new kernel file in the folder "/out/Download/flash/"
  -- Rename the new kernel file "kernel_newmann1.bin" to "kernel"

- Create new boot.img:
  -- Repack the new generated kernel file with ramdisk.
